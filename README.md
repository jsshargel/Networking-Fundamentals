# Hosts, IP Addresses, Networks - Networking Fundamentals - Lesson 1a
- Hosts are any device that sends or receives traffic such as computers, laptops, phones, etc.
- Many cloud resources, such as cloud servers, can also be considered hosts.
- Also, Internet of Things, anything in your house that sends or receives traffic is also considered a host: smart TVs, speakers, smartwatches, etc.
- All those devices are sending and receiving traffic and therefore can be considered as hosts.
- All these devices follow the same rules for how they communicate to the internet.
- Hosts typically fall into one of two categories: clients or servers.
- Clients are the hosts that are initiating the request, and servers are the hosts that are responding to requests.
